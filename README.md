### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aslan! I am a software engineer, based in New York City.
The magic of turning code into vibrant life is my calling. My digital toolkit is TypeScript, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL. I also work with Javascript frameworks such as React and Next.js to create efficient products that boast meaningful aesthetics.  When I'm not diving into my VS Code universe, I'm likely improvising something tasty in the kitchen, practicing Jiu Jitsu or on a scenic trail for a zen ride. Let's collaborate to engineer your next solution!
