### Hi there, my name is Aslan ðŸ‘‹
 As a software engineer with an artistic background, I am passionate
            about solving problems at the intersection of design and
            engineering. Using technology to improve people's experiences and
            bringing them closer together excites me, and my curiousity to learn
            and grow in such a fast-paced dynamic environment drives me forward.
